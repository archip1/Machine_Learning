\question{10}
Alberta Hospital occasionally has electrical problems. It can take some time to find the problem, though it is always found in no more than 10 hours. The amount of time is variable; for example, one time it might take 0.3 hours, and another time it might take 5.7 hours. The time (in hours) necessary to find and fix an electrical problem at Alberta Hospital is a random variable, say $X$, whose density is given by the following uniform distribution
%
\begin{align*}
p(x)=
\left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    \frac{1}{10} &  \text{if } 0 \le x \le 10\\
    0 &  \text{otherwise}
  \end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}

Such electrical problems can be costly for the Hospital, more so the longer it takes to fix it. The cost of an electrical breakdown of duration $x$ is $x^3$.
