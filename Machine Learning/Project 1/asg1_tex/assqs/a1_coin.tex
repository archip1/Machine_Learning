\question{15}

 Suppose you have three coins. Coin A has a probability of
  heads of $0.75$, Coin B has a probability of heads of $0.5$, 
  and Coin C has a probability of heads of $0.25$.

  \subquestion{5} Suppose you flip all three coins at once, and let $X$ be the number of
  heads you see (which will be between 0 and 3).
  What is the expected value of $X$, $E[X]$?
  
\subquestion{10} Suppose instead you put all three coins in your
  pocket, select one at random, and then flip that coin 5 times. You
  notice that 3 of the 5 flips result in heads while the other 2 are
  tails. What is the probability that you chose Coin C? Hint: Define random variable $D$ as the observed data, and notice that you can compute $p(D = \text{3 heads and 2 tails} | \text{Coin} = C)$.
