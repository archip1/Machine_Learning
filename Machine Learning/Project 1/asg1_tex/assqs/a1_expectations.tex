\question{15}

Let $X$ be a random variable with outcome space $\Omega=\{a,b,c\}$ and  $p(a)=0.1, p(b)=0.2$, and $p(c)=0.7$. Let 
%
\begin{align*}
f(x)=
\left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    10 &  \text{if } x = a\\
    5 &  \text{if } x = b\\
    10/7 & \text{if } x = c
  \end{array}
\right.
\end{align*}

\subquestion{4} 
What is $E[f(X)]$?

\subquestion{3} 
What is $E[1/p(X)]$? (Note: This is an expectation about the probability)

\subquestion{4} 
For an arbitrary pmf $p$, what is $E[1/p(X)]$? (Note: This is an expectation about the probability)

\subquestion{4} 
What is $E[f(X)^{2}]$ and $E[f(X)]^{2}$?
